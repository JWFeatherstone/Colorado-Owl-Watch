    identification: 'Large owl, mottled brown and white with a white throat and black eyes. Rounded head lacks ear tufts. Vertical brown streaks on chest. Horizontal brown streaks on belly, back, wings, and tail.',
    call: 'Listen for its instantly recognizable “Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all” call.',
    behaviors: 'Favors large, mature forests with deciduous and coniferous trees, often near water. Hunts small animals at night; however, is more active during the day than other owls.',
    migration: 'Rarely seen in Colorado, year-round resident in the Pacific Northwest and eastern U.S.',

    call: `Boreal Owls are fairly silent, except from mid-February to April; a good time to go looking and listening for one. Their highly nocturnal habits mean that you'll need to head out at night to get a glimpse or hear their low hooting calls.`,
    behaviors: 'This bright-eyed, square faced owl sits and waits on a perch for small mammals and birds before gliding down talons first to grab it. From late winter through spring, its quick, hollow hooting sounds across the dark forest as the male calls for a mate. Look for them in aspen, birch, or conifer trees around 15–20 feet above the ground, close to the tree trunk.',
