      <p className="high-level-blurb tip-sub"><b>Keep your distance! </b>As with most birds, keeping a distance that doesnâ€™t stress the bird also keeps the bird in view for longer looks. Every bird has their own sense of how close they can tolerate people before they are disturbed. But, if the owl sees you and starts to change position or fly off, you are too close.  </p>
      <p className="high-level-blurb tip-sub"><b>Limit the use of call playback. </b>While playing owl calls may elicit a response to your recorded call, and lets you know which birds are in the area, it also lets other owls in the area know where their competitors are. Smaller owls are made vulnerable to predation by their larger cousins if they reveal their location unnecessarily. </p>
      <p className="high-level-blurb tip-sub"><b>Be patient. </b>Owls are solitary creatures and you're unlikely to just bump into one. Keep an open mind - worst case scenario, you spent some time in the woods.  </p>
      <p className="high-level-blurb tip-sub"><b>Less looking; more listening. </b>Given thier camoflauge, relative scarcity, and generally nocturnal activity habits, your best luck in finding an owl is often to listen out for their calls, rather than spotting one in the dark.    </p>
